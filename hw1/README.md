## Data

**Target variable:** `electricity cost` — electricity cost of a building.

**Features:**

| Feature | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `site area` | numerical | area of the site |
| `water consumption` | numerical | water consumption |
| `recycling rate` | numerical | waste recycling rate |
| `utilisation rate` | numerical | building utilisation rate |
| `air quality index` | numerical | air quality index |
| `issue resolution time` | numerical | time to resolve maintenance issues |
| `resident count` | numerical | number of residents |
| `has residents` | binary | whether the building has residents (created in FE) |
| `type_residential` | binary | building type: residential |
| `type_commercial` | binary | building type: commercial |
| `type_mixed_use` | binary | building type: mixed-use |
| `type_industrial` | binary | building type: industrial |
| `structure_type_enc` | categorical | building type (label encoded) |

## Notebooks

### 01_EDA.ipynb — Exploratory Data Analysis

- Loading and initial inspection (shape, dtypes, missing values)
- Distributions of numerical features (histograms, boxplots)
- Outlier detection using the IQR method
- Feature correlation matrix
- Target variable analysis by building type
- Scatter plots: `site area` vs `electricity cost` (r=0.9), `water consumption` vs `electricity cost` (r=0.7)

---

### 02_FE.ipynb — Feature Engineering

- Outlier removal via IQR for `water consumption` and `resident count`
- New binary feature `has residents` (`resident count > 0`)
- One-Hot Encoding of `structure type` → `type_residential`, `type_commercial`, `type_mixed_use`, `type_industrial`
- Label Encoding of `structure type` → `structure_type_enc` (Residential=0, Commercial=1, Mixed-use=2, Industrial=3)
- Correlation analysis of all features with the target variable after FE
- Saving final `X.csv` and `y.csv`

### 03_model.ipynb — Modelling

**Train/test split:** 80% train / 20% test, `random_state=42`

**Models:**

- **LightGBM** — gradient boosting, no scaler needed
- **XGBoost** — gradient boosting, no scaler needed
- **ElasticNet** — linear model wrapped in a `Pipeline` with `StandardScaler`  # excluded from the final comparison due to significantly higher RMSE

**Hyperparameter tuning:** Optuna, 50 trials per model, 5-fold cross-validation, metric `neg_RMSE`.

**Model interpretation:** SHAP `TreeExplainer` for LightGBM and XGBoost — feature importance by mean |SHAP value|.
